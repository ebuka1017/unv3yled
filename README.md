# Unv3iled

Unv3iled is a cultural intelligence engine that helps you discover things and people you'll love before you know you love them. It connects your Spotify data to Qloo’s Taste AI and Gemini 2.5 Flash to build a multi-domain understanding of your unique preferences — across music, books, films, fashion, travel, and relationships. Powered by real-time chat and voice interaction, Unv3iled doesn’t just recommend — it reflects who you are.

## 🧠 Core Concept

Taste is not just preference — it's a pattern.
Unv3iled captures and builds your cultural fingerprint over time, then maps it across domains using:

* **Qloo Taste AI** for cross-domain correlation
* **Gemini 2.5 Flash** for insight, explanation, and reasoning
* **Spotify** for real, personal behavior-based data
* **Supabase** for auth, storage, and real-time infrastructure
* **ElevenLabs** for real-time voice conversation

It’s not just “what to watch” or “what to wear” — it’s *who you are* and *who you'll connect with*.

## ✨ Features

### 🎧 Spotify Taste Integration

Connects to your Spotify account to read your listening history, top tracks, top artists, playlists, and recently played music — forming the foundation of your taste profile.

### 🧠 Qloo-Driven Taste Mapping

Uses Qloo’s Taste AI to map your preferences across cultural domains including books, movies, fashion, travel destinations, restaurants, and more.

### 🤖 AI-Powered Explanation

Every recommendation is paired with insight generated by Gemini 2.5 Flash. It explains *why* you’d like something — not just *what* you might like.

### 🧍‍♂️ Taste Twin Finder

Unv3iled compares your cultural signature to others and surfaces your closest “taste twin” — someone with nearly identical patterns. You can explore their profile and chat in-app.

### 🎙️ Voice Interaction

Full voice-to-voice conversation powered by ElevenLabs. You can talk to Unv3iled like a friend — ask for recommendations, explanations, and insights without touching the screen.

### ✨ Serendipity

Unv3iled is designed to surprise you. It surfaces unexpected but meaningful results — things you didn’t even know you were looking for — based on deep cross-domain patterns.

### 🎬 Rich Media Embeds

Live previews of all recommendations:

* **Spotify** embeds for music and playlists
* **YouTube** for trailers, interviews, or music videos
* **Book covers + purchase links**
* **Movie/TV posters with stream availability**
* **Travel destinations with map links and imagery**

### 🧬 Evolving Taste Profile

Unv3iled grows with you. Every time you interact — search, chat, explore — your taste profile becomes more refined.
Each Qloo API call includes your full updated history, leading to smarter matches and better understanding over time.
